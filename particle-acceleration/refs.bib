 abstract = {We formulate a magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell (MHD-PIC) method for describing the interaction between collisionless cosmic ray (CR) particles and a thermal plasma. The thermal plasma is treated as a fluid, obeying equations of ideal MHD, while CRs are treated as relativistic Lagrangian particles subject to the Lorentz force. Backreaction from CRs to the gas is included in the form of momentum and energy feedback. In addition, we include the electromagnetic feedback due to CR-induced Hall effect that becomes important when the electron-ion drift velocity of the background plasma induced by CRs approaches the Alfv$\backslash$'en velocity. Our method is applicable on scales much larger than the ion inertial length, bypassing the microscopic scales that must be resolved in conventional PIC methods, while retaining the full kinetic nature of the CRs. We have implemented and tested this method in the Athena MHD code, where the overall scheme is second-order accurate and fully conservative. As a first application, we describe a numerical experiment to study particle acceleration in non-relativistic shocks. Using a simplified prescription for ion injection, we reproduce the shock structure and the CR energy spectra obtained with more self-consistent hybrid-PIC simulations, but at substantially reduced computational cost. We also show that the CR-induced Hall effect reduces the growth rate of the Bell instability and affects the gas dynamics in the vicinity of the shock front. As a step forward, we are able to capture the transition of particle acceleration from non relativistic to relativistic regimes, with momentum spectrum $f(p)\sim p^{-4}$ connecting smoothly through the transition, as expected from the theory of Fermi acceleration.},

Surprisingly, decades of extensive investigation have not yet resulted in a realistic unified picture of the multidimensional unstable spectrum within a fully relativistic and kinetic framework. All attempts made so far in this direction were indeed restricted to simplistic distribution functions and/or did not aim at a complete mapping of the beam-plasma parameter space. The present Letter comprehensively tackles this problem by implementing an exact linear model. Three kinds of modes compete in the linear phase, which can be classified according to the direction of their wave number with respect to the beam. We determine their respective domain of preponderance in a three-dimensional parameter space and support our results with multidimensional particle-in-cell simulations.},

In contrast to a number of previously published studies, our linear analysis makes use of smooth momentum distribution functions of the Maxwell-J{\"u}ttner form. The three competing classes of instabilities, namely, two-stream, filamentation, and oblique modes, are dealt with in a unified manner, no approximation being made regarding the beam-plasma densities, temperatures, and drift energies. We investigate the hierarchy between the competing modes, paying particular attention to the relatively poorly known quasielectrostatic oblique modes in the regime where they govern the system. The properties of the fastest growing oblique modes are examined in terms of the system parameters and compared to those of the dominant two-stream and filamentation modes.},

 abstract = {Inverse Compton cascades (ICCs) initiated by energetic gamma rays (E $\gt$\~{} 100 GeV) enhance the GeV emission from bright, extragalactic TeV sources. The absence of this emission from bright TeV blazars has been used to constrain the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), and the stringent limits placed on the unresolved extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB) by Fermi have been used to argue against a large number of such objects at high redshifts. However, these are predicated on the assumption that inverse Compton scattering is the primary energy-loss mechanism for the ultrarelativistic pairs produced by the annihilation of the energetic gamma rays on extragalactic background light photons. Here, we show that for sufficiently bright TeV sources (isotropic-equivalent luminosities $\gt$\~{} 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) plasma beam instabilities, specifically the ``oblique'' instability, present a plausible mechanism by which the energy of these pairs can be dissipated locally, heating the intergalactic medium. Since these instabilities typically grow on timescales short in comparison to the inverse Compton cooling rate, they necessarily suppress the ICCs. As a consequence, this places a severe constraint on efforts to limit the IGMF from the lack of a discernible GeV bump in TeV sources. Similarly, it considerably weakens the Fermi limits on the evolution of blazar populations. Specifically, we construct a TeV-blazar luminosity function from those objects currently observed and find that it is very well described by the quasar luminosity function at z \~{} 0.1, shifted to lower luminosities and number densities, suggesting that both classes of sources are regulated by similar processes. Extending this relationship to higher redshifts, we show that the magnitude and shape of the EGRB above \~{}10 GeV are naturally reproduced with this particular example of a rapidly evolving TeV-blazar luminosity function.},

It treats the convective terms in the x and v directions separately and produces a scheme of second order in the time step. The resulting freestreaming and accelerating equations are computed with Fourier interpolation and spline interpolation methods respectively. The numerical method is tested with linear and nonlinear problems. The method is very accurate and efficient. A new method of smoothing the distribution function is given. It reduces the computational effort by artificially increasing the entropy of the system. As a result, the distribution function is smooth enough to be well represented on a given mesh.},

The method is valid for an arbitrary quasi-particle form-factor assuming that quasi-particle trajectory over time step is a straight line. The method allows one to implement the PIC code without solving Poisson equation. The presented formula for the current density associated with the motion of a single quasi-particle is the unique linear combination of form-factor differences in consistency with the discrete continuity equation. The computation scheme is demonstrated in 2D and 3D.}

Successive shifts were effected by Fourier interpolation and cubic spline interpolation. In the present paper, a cubic spline interpolation is used throughout. The method is applied to linear Landau damping to calculate the amplitude oscillations which develop for small values of the ratio of the linear Landau damping rate to the bounce frequency of trapped particles. The example shows the code to be stable, accurate and efficient, and there were no problems associated with thermal fluctuations of macroscopic quantities.},

 abstract = {An anisotropic plasma exhibits a transverse instability due to the mutual attraction of the microscopic current elements. A detailed study is made of this instability in an electron-ion plasma without any external magnetic field. The system is characterized by a temperature tensor and described by a quasi-Maxwellian distribution function. The dielectric tensor for such a system is calculated and then the dispersion relation is considered. It is found that there are two unstable modes: (i) a purely transverse mode and (ii) a coupled or transverse-longitudinal mode. The latter separates into two branches: (a) the first is an essentially unstable quasitransverse mode, (b) the second is the quasi-longitudinal ion acoustic mode driven into instability through its interaction with the quasitransverse mode. Growth rate, k and angular dependence, domain of instability, and polarization are analyzed in detail.}

 abstract = {This introductory account of instabilities in plasmas concentrates on laboratory plasmas, such as those encountered in fusion research, and the space plasmas studied in physics of the magnetosphere and solar atmosphere.  This account bridges the gap between a graduate textbook on plasma physics, and specialized similarities between astrophysical and laboratory plasmas that are traditionally regarded as quite separate. The author, an expert in plasma astrophysics who has written a two-volume book on the subject, treats the material naturally, lending a broader perspective to the subject.    This is an instructional text for graduate students and professionals in magnetospheric and mathematical physics, radiophysics, solar and theoretical astrophysics and radio astronomy.},

This instability can be excited in a plasma with two electron populations: the background cold electrons and the high energy electrons accelerated by the laser radiation. Here we investigate the nonlinear stage of the evolution of this instability both analytically and numerically. We consider both the non-relativistic and the relativistic regimes within the frame-work of a cold two-electron fluid plasma description, where ions are assumed to be at rest and to provide a uniform neutralizing background.},

 abstract = {A computer program which solves the dispersion relation of waves in a magnetized plasma is described. The dielectric tensor is derived using the kinetic theory of homogeneous plasmas with Maxwellian velocity distributions. Up to six different plasma components can be included in the program, and each component is specified by its density, temperature, particle mass, anisotropy and drift velocity along the magnetic field. The program is thus applicable to a very wide class of plasmas, and the method should in general be useful whenever a homogeneous magnetized plasma can be approximated by a linear combination of Maxwellian components. The general theory underlying the program is outlined. It is shown that by introducing a Pade approximant for the plasma dispersion function Z, the infinite sums of modified Bessel functions which appear in the dielectric tensor may be reduced to a summable form.},

Accuracy, stability, efficiency properties and the implementation of a new algorithm of charge conservation when solving Maxwell equations are discussed. The performances of the code are tested by studying the evolution of Weibel-type instabilities in the relativistic regime. Application to the coupling between Current Filamentation (CFI) and Two-Stream (TSI) instabilities is presented showing the importance of pair-wise vortex merging scenario in the saturation mechanism.},

 abstract = {Numerical heating in particle-in-cell (PIC) codes currently precludes the accurate simulation of cold, relativistic plasma over long periods, severely limiting their applications in astrophysical environments. We present a spatially higher-order accurate relativistic PIC algorithm in one spatial dimension, which conserves charge and momentum exactly. We utilize the smoothness implied by the usage of higher-order interpolation functions to achieve a spatially higher-order accurate algorithm (up to the fifth order). We validate our algorithm against several test problems{\mdash}thermal stability of stationary plasma, stability of linear plasma waves, and two-stream instability in the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. Comparing our simulations to exact solutions of the dispersion relations, we demonstrate that SHARP can quantitatively reproduce important kinetic features of the linear regime. Our simulations have a superior ability to control energy non-conservation and avoid numerical heating in comparison to common second-order schemes. We provide a natural definition for convergence of a general PIC algorithm: the complement of physical modes captured by the simulation, I.e., those that lie above the Poisson noise, must grow commensurately with the resolution. This implies that it is necessary to simultaneously increase the number of particles per cell and decrease the cell size. We demonstrate that traditional ways for testing for convergence fail, leading to plateauing of the energy error. This new PIC code enables us to faithfully study the long-term evolution of plasma problems that require absolute control of the energy and momentum conservation.},

We explore a range of inclination angles between the pre-shock magnetic field and the shock normal. We find that only magnetic inclinations corresponding to ``subluminal'' shocks, where relativistic particles following the magnetic field can escape ahead of the shock, lead to particle acceleration. The downstream spectrum in such shocks consists of a relativistic Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail with exponential cutoff. For increasing magnetic inclination in the subluminal range, the high-energy tail accounts for an increasing fraction of particles (from \~{}1\% to \~{}2\%) and energy (from \~{}4\% to \~{}12\%). The spectral index of the power law increases with angle from -2.8 {\plusmn} 0.1 to -2.3 {\plusmn} 0.1. For nearly parallel shocks, particle energization mostly proceeds via the diffusive shock acceleration process; the upstream scattering is provided by oblique waves which are generated by the high-energy particles that escape upstream. For larger subluminal inclinations, shock-drift acceleration is the main acceleration mechanism, and the upstream oblique waves regulate injection into the acceleration process. For ``superluminal'' shocks, self-generated shock turbulence is not strong enough to overcome the kinematic constraints, and the downstream particle spectrum does not show any significant suprathermal tail. As seen from the upstream frame, efficient acceleration in relativistic (Lorentz factor {$\gamma$}$_{0}$ gsim 5) magnetized ({$\sigma$} gsim 0.03) flows exists only for a very small range of magnetic inclination angles (lsim34{\deg}/{$\gamma$}$_{0}$), so relativistic astrophysical pair shocks have to be either nearly parallel or weakly magnetized to generate nonthermal particles. These findings place constraints on the models of pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray bursts, and jets from active galactic nuclei that invoke particle acceleration in relativistic magnetized shocks.},

 abstract = {The termination shock of pulsar winds and internal shocks in gamma-ray bursts and AGN jets are likely to be seeded with a substantial magnetic field (ratio of magnetic to kinetic energy density $\gt$ few percent), oriented mostly perpendicular to the shock normal. By means of 2.5D particle-in-cell simulations, we study how the efficiency of particle acceleration in relativistic shocks depends on the magnetization ``sigma'' of the pre-shock flow and the inclination angle between the field and the shock normal, for mass ratios between 1 and 100. If sigma$\gt$0.03, we find that only ``subluminal'' shocks, where relativistic particles can escape ahead of the shock along the field, lead to particle acceleration. The downstream ion spectrum in such shocks consists of a relativistic Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail, which accounts for  3\% of ions and  10\% of flow energy. For electron-proton shocks (i.e., mass ratio $\gt$ few tens), the number of supra-thermal electrons is typically smaller than ions by a factor of  5-10, since electrons are effectively more magnetized and get quickly advected downstream. For ``superluminal'' shocks, self-generated turbulence is not strong enough to overcome the kinematic constraints, and the downstream particle spectrum does not show any significant supra-thermal tail. As seen from the upstream frame, efficient acceleration in relativistic (Lorentz factor gamma$\gt$5) magnetized (sigma$\gt$0.03) flows exists only for nearly-parallel magnetic fields (obliquity$\lt$30/gamma deg). Since most of magnetized astrophysical shocks are quasi-perpendicular, our findings may place challenging constraints on the models of non-thermal radiation that invoke particle acceleration in relativistic magnetized shocks.},

We explore a range of inclination angles between the pre-shock magnetic field and the shock normal. In ``subluminal'' shocks, where relativistic particles can escape ahead of the shock along the magnetic field lines, ions are efficiently accelerated via the first-order Fermi process. The downstream ion spectrum consists of a relativistic Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail, which contains \~{}5\% of ions and \~{}30\% of ion energy. Its slope is -2.1 {\plusmn} 0.1. The scattering is provided by short-wavelength non-resonant modes produced by Bell's instability, whose growth is seeded by the current of shock-accelerated ions that propagate ahead of the shock. Upstream electrons enter the shock with lower energy than ions (albeit by only a factor of \~{}5 Lt m$_{i}$ /m$_{e}$ ), so they are more strongly tied to the field. As a result, only \~{}1\% of the incoming electrons are accelerated at the shock before being advected downstream, where they populate a steep power-law tail (with slope -3.5 {\plusmn} 0.1). For ``superluminal'' shocks, where relativistic particles cannot outrun the shock along the field, the self-generated turbulence is not strong enough to permit efficient Fermi acceleration, and the ion and electron downstream spectra are consistent with thermal distributions. The incoming electrons are heated up to equipartition with ions, due to strong electromagnetic waves emitted by the shock into the upstream. Thus, efficient electron heating (gsim15\% of the upstream ion energy) is the universal property of relativistic electron-ion shocks, but significant nonthermal acceleration of electrons (gsim2\% by number, gsim10\% by energy, with slope flatter than -2.5) is hard to achieve in magnetized flows and requires weakly magnetized shocks (magnetization {$\sigma$} $\lt$\~{} 10$^{-3}$), where magnetic fields self-generated via the Weibel instability are stronger than the background field.

The shape of the post-shock spectrum depends primarily on the ratio {$\lambda$}/(r$_{L}$ {$\sigma$}), where r$_{L}$ is the relativistic Larmor radius in the wind. The spectrum becomes broader as the value of {$\lambda$}/(r$_{L}$ {$\sigma$}) increases, passing from a relativistic Maxwellian to a flat power-law tail with slope around -1.5, populated by particles accelerated by the reconnection electric field. Close to the equatorial plane of the wind, where the stripes are symmetric, the highest energy particles resulting from magnetic reconnection can escape ahead of the shock, and be injected into a Fermi-like acceleration process. In the post-shock spectrum, they populate a power-law tail with slope around -2.5, which extends beyond the flat component produced by reconnection. Our study suggests that the spectral break between the radio and the optical band in Pulsar Wind Nebulae can be a natural consequence of particle acceleration at the termination shock of striped pulsar winds.},

 abstract = {The afterglow emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is usually interpreted as synchrotron radiation from electrons accelerated at the GRB external shock that propagates with relativistic velocities into the magnetized interstellar medium. By means of multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the acceleration performance of weakly magnetized relativistic shocks, in the magnetization range 0 $\lt$\~{} {$\sigma$} $\lt$\~{} 10$^{-1}$. The pre-shock magnetic field is orthogonal to the flow, as generically expected for relativistic shocks. We find that relativistic perpendicular shocks propagating in electron-positron plasmas are efficient particle accelerators if the magnetization is {$\sigma$} $\lt$\~{} 10$^{-3}$. For electron-ion plasmas, the transition to efficient acceleration occurs for {$\sigma$} $\lt$\~{} 3 {\times} 10$^{-5}$. Here, the acceleration process proceeds similarly for the two species, since the electrons enter the shock nearly in equipartition with the ions, as a result of strong pre-heating in the self-generated upstream turbulence. In both electron-positron and electron-ion shocks, we find that the maximum energy of the accelerated particles scales in time as {$\epsilon$}$_{max}$vpropt $^{1/2}$. This scaling is shallower than the so-called (and commonly assumed) Bohm limit {$\epsilon$}$_{max}$vpropt, and it naturally results from the small-scale nature of the Weibel turbulence generated in the shock layer. In magnetized plasmas, the energy of the accelerated particles increases until it reaches a saturation value {$\epsilon$}$_{sat}$/{$\gamma$}$_{0}$ m$_{i}$c $^{2}$ \~{} {$\sigma$}$^{-1/4}$, where {$\gamma$}$_{0}$ m$_{i}$c $^{2}$ is the mean energy per particle in the upstream bulk flow. Further energization is prevented by the fact that the self-generated turbulence is confined within a finite region of thickness vprop{$\sigma$}$^{-1/2}$ around the shock. Our results can provide physically grounded inputs for models of non-thermal emission from a variety of astrophysical sources, with particular relevance to GRB afterglows.},

 abstract = {In magnetized astrophysical outflows, the dissipation of field energy into particle energy via magnetic reconnection is often invoked to explain the observed non-thermal signatures. By means of two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate anti-parallel reconnection in magnetically dominated electron-positron plasmas. Our simulations extend to unprecedentedly long temporal and spatial scales, so we can capture the asymptotic state of the system beyond the initial transients, and without any artificial limitation by the boundary conditions. At late times, the reconnection layer is organized into a chain of large magnetic islands connected by thin X-lines. The plasmoid instability further fragments each X-line into a series of smaller islands, separated by X-points. At the X-points, the particles become unmagnetized and they get accelerated along the reconnection electric field. We provide definitive evidence that the late-time particle spectrum integrated over the whole reconnection region is a power law whose slope is harder than -2 for magnetizations {$\sigma$} $\gt$\~{} 10. Efficient particle acceleration to non-thermal energies is a generic by-product of the long-term evolution of relativistic reconnection in both two and three dimensions. In three dimensions, the drift-kink mode corrugates the reconnection layer at early times, but the long-term evolution is controlled by the plasmoid instability which facilitates efficient particle acceleration, analogous to the two-dimensional physics. Our findings have important implications for the generation of hard photon spectra in pulsar winds and relativistic astrophysical jets.},

The shock structure is mainly controlled by the shock's magnetization (``sigma'' parameter). We demonstrate how the structure of the shock varies as a function of sigma for perpendicular shocks. At low magnetizations the shock is mediated mainly by the Weibel instability which generates transient magnetic fields that can exceed the initial field. At larger magnetizations the shock is dominated by magnetic reflections. We demonstrate where the transition occurs and argue that it is impossible to have very low magnetization collisionless shocks in nature (in more than one spatial dimension). We further discuss the acceleration properties of these shocks, and show that higher magnetization perpendicular shocks do not efficiently accelerate nonthermal particles in 3D. Among other astrophysical applications, this may pose a restriction on the structure and composition of gamma-ray bursts and pulsar wind outflows.},

Then, a numerical filter is implemented that preserves positivity and non-oscillatory. The numerical results of both one-dimensional linear advection and two-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson simulations show that the numerical diffusion with the fourth-degree polynomial interpolation is suppressed more than with the cubic polynomial interpolation. It is also found that inherent conservation properties of the Vlasov equation can be improved by combining numerical fluxes of the upwind-biased and central fourth-degree polynomial interpolations.}

Issues related to the use of the standard Boris particle pusher are identified and a novel pusher which circumvents them is proposed, whose effectiveness is demonstrated on single particle tests. A procedure for solving the fields is proposed, which retains electrostatic, magnetostatic, and inductive field effects in the direction of the mean velocity of the species, is fully explicit and simpler than the full Darwin approximation. Finally, results are given, from a calculation using the novel features, of an ultrarelativistic beam interacting with a background of electrons.},

 abstract = {A general, fast, and effective approach is developed for numerical calculation of kinetic plasma linear dispersion relations. The plasma dispersion function is approximated by J-pole expansion. Subsequently, the dispersion relation is transformed to a standard matrix eigenvalue problem of an equivalent linear system. Numerical solutions for the least damped or fastest growing modes using an 8-pole expansion are generally accurate; more strongly damped modes are less accurate, but are less likely to be of physical interest. In contrast to conventional approaches, such as Newton's iterative method, this approach can give either all the solutions in the system or a few solutions around the initial guess. It is also free from convergence problems. The approach is demonstrated for electrostatic dispersion equations with one-dimensional and two-dimensional wavevectors, and for electromagnetic kinetic magnetized plasma dispersion relation for bi-Maxwellian distribution with relative parallel velocity flows between species.  supported by the National Magnetic Confinement Fusion Science Program of China (Nos. 2015GB110003, 2011GB105001, 2013GB111000), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 91130031), the Recruitment Program of Global Youth Experts},
