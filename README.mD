# Collection of notes

These are my random notes on various physics concepts. Most of them are done in connection to some publication. 

These are not rigorous and are likely to contain typos. So don't quote me on these! If you see some mistakes, let me know and I'll do my best to fix them.


## More or less stable 

- [Relativistic plasma physics](plasma-physics/notes.pdf)
- [Digital filtering](filtering/notes.pdf)



## Under construction

- [Force-free MHD](ffe/notes.pdf)
- [Turbulence (literature review)](turbulence/notes.pdf)
- [Particle acceleration](particle-acceleration/notes.pdf)
